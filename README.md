# Hi there, I'm Goutham! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository! This is where I document my journey in web development and showcase my projects as I learn and grow in the field. ðŸŒ±

## About Me

I'm a passionate learner with a keen interest in web development. Currently, I have a solid understanding of HTML and CSS, and I'm exploring the fascinating world of JavaScript. My ultimate goal is to become proficient in the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js) and build exciting, full-stack web applications.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects you can find in this repository:

1. **Amazon Clone:** A fully functional e-commerce website inspired by Amazon, built with React for the frontend, Firebase for authentication and database, and Stripe for handling payments.

2. **JavaScript Calculator:** A calculator application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to practice my frontend skills. It supports basic arithmetic operations and has a clean user interface.

3. **MEME Generator:** A fun MEME generator web app developed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allowing users to create hilarious memes by adding text to popular meme templates.

## Learning Path

As I continue my web development journey, my learning path includes:

- Deepening my understanding of JavaScript concepts like ES6, asynchronous programming, and promises.
- Mastering frontend libraries and frameworks like React to build dynamic and interactive user interfaces.
- Exploring backend development with Node.js and Express to create robust server-side applications.
- Diving into databases like MongoDB to handle data efficiently in my projects.

## Get in Touch

I'm always open to collaborations and connecting with fellow developers! If you have any feedback, suggestions, or just want to chat about web development, feel free to reach out to me.
